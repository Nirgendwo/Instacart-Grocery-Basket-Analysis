# Instacart-Grocery-Basket-Analysis
I worked as an analyst for an existing company, Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app. My task was to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.
### Content
As you may have already noticed, two folds are missing. Folder 01 Project Management and 02 Data. The reason for that is firstly I the 01 Folder didn't had any content and the 02 Folder contained to big Data-set and it seemed senseless to update those since I already finished analysing the data before uploading this project to GitHub.  
03 Scripts: contains all the scripts I created during the analysis, each script has a Table of Contents  
04 Analysis: containes all the visualizations that I created during the analysis  
05 Sent to client: containes the final report I submitted to the stakeholders
